using this to store tasks for companies.

Some things to note about this project.

1.Although i had about 1 and a half weeks to do it, ive been busy working overtime a lot so struggled to find the space to do this. 
2.There are a lot that i would do differently and more appropriatly in an actual product im building for someone.
3. I chose .Net6 due to the power of its Web api integrations however my IDE does not seem to want to stick to make up its own coding standard.
4. overall happy with the swagger integration and i used that as a primary testing tool due to running low on time and energy.


In conclution i wish i had more freedom to spend my freetime with to implement something truly awesome, but had to cut corners to get as much of what i know how to do in a project as possible.
